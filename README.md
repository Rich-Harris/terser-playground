A very incomplete playground for seeing how [Terser](https://github.com/terser-js/terser/) minifies JavaScript.

TODO:

* use CodeMirror or something instead of a plain textarea
* support options
* highlight error locations
* use sourcemaps to link a given chunk of input to its corresponding output
* permalinks
